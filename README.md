###Project Task - Getting and Cleaning Data
========================================
##Hi!

This file will walk you through how to use this script.
* First please install package data.table. This is a really useful package to calculate the last part of the task
* Then please unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. Make sure that you rename the unzipped folder as "data".
* Now please copy run_analysis.R script into the same directory where the data directory is.
* Start RStudio, make this parent folder to your working directory
* Source("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio. 
* Congratulations! you have succesfully used this script. The script will show the results. You may find the following outputs saved as txt files:
  - full_data.txt:this is the full, cleaned dataset
  - mean_data.txt: calculated means

Thank you for checking my work!
